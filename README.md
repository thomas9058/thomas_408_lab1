# web-dev-starter

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects
that are written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Before You Get Started
- Node.js
- Visual Studio Code

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Running the Site
1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Install the **Live Preview** extension if you don’t already have it.
3. Open `index.html`.
4. Start the dev server:
   - Command Palette → `Live Preview: Show Preview`
   - Right click → `Show Preview`
5. Your browser will open at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` or possibly another port.
6. Any changes to HTML, CSS, or JS will hot reload in the browser. No need to refresh the page.

## Debugging
1. Open `js/main.js` in VS Code.
2. Go to the **Run and Debug** view (play button with bug on sidebar).
3. Select **Debug Website** and click the green start arrow.
4. Set a breakpoint in your code.
5. Refresh the page in the browser and VS Code will pause at your breakpoint.
